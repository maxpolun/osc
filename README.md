osc
===

This is a prototype to play with the AudioContext api in newer versions of firefox/chrome. 
It visualizes and plays basic audio signals. It only runs in very recent versions of FIrefox 
and Chrome. It has no testing at all. It was mostly written on the train.

Goals for the future:

* add custom/arbitrary functions rather than just the standard sine/square/triangle/sawtooth
* phase
* mix multiple oscillators together

Eventaully if I keep working on it, I'll re-write it (probably in a seperate project).
